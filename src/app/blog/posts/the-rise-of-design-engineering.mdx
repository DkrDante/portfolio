# My Developer Workflow Using macOS, tmux, and Neovim with Lazy Config

Hi! Today I'm gonna talk about my daily developer workflow and all the tools I use to set up a productive environment for coding. I think having a nice-looking terminal and some tools to save time are really helpful to keep you productive in daily coding sessions.

## Operating System

I use **macOS** as my primary development environment. macOS provides a Unix-based system with great developer tools and is perfect for software development. With **Homebrew**, I can easily install and manage packages like a pro.

## Shell

macOS ships with **zsh** as the default shell, and I stick with it. To enhance my zsh experience, I use **Powerlevel10k** for my prompt. Powerlevel10k is highly customizable, fast, and provides an elegant prompt setup.

### Installing Powerlevel10k

To install Powerlevel10k, use:

```sh
brew install romkatv/powerlevel10k/powerlevel10k
```

Then, configure it by running:

```sh
p10k configure
```

## Prompt Configuration

Hereâ€™s my **Powerlevel10k** configuration snippet:

```sh
# ~/.zshrc
source $(brew --prefix)/share/powerlevel10k/powerlevel10k.zsh-theme
```

Powerlevel10k makes my terminal not only aesthetically pleasing but also functional, displaying Git status, time, and system info in a neat way.

## Persistent Terminal Sessions with tmux

[tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) is a terminal multiplexer. It allows me to manage multiple terminal sessions, switch between workspaces, and keep processes running even after I close my terminal.

### My tmux Workflow

I use tmux to quickly navigate between projects:

```sh
alias work="tmux attach-session -t work"
```

Now, I can type `work` and jump right into my tmux session!

## Neovim with Lazy Config

I use **Neovim** as my primary code editor with **Lazy.nvim** as my plugin manager. Neovim is lightweight, fast, and allows deep customization.

### Installing Neovim and Lazy.nvim

```sh
brew install neovim
```

To set up Lazy.nvim, run:

```sh
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim ~/.config/nvim/lazy.nvim
```

### My Neovim Config

My Neovim configuration is designed for speed and productivity. Hereâ€™s a snippet from my **init.lua**:

```lua
require("lazy").setup({
  { "nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim", dependencies = { "nvim-lua/plenary.nvim" } },
  { "neovim/nvim-lspconfig" },
  { "hrsh7th/nvim-cmp" },
})
```

Neovim with Lazy.nvim allows me to extend my editor with powerful plugins like LSP support, fuzzy finding, and auto-completion.

## Productivity Boosters

Here are a few more tools I use to enhance my workflow:

- **[zoxide](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide)** â€“ Smarter `cd` command for quick directory navigation.
- **[exa](https://the.exa.website/)** â€“ A modern replacement for `ls` with better formatting and icons.
- **[fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)** â€“ Fuzzy finder for navigating files and command history quickly.

### My `zshrc` Aliases

```sh
alias ll="exa -l --icons"
alias llt="exa -T --icons"
alias z="zoxide"
```

## Conclusion

That was a quick overview of all the tools I use daily for coding on macOS. Setting up a productive environment takes time, but once you have it fine-tuned, it significantly boosts your efficiency.

I hope you found my workflow helpful and maybe even incorporated some of these tools into your setup!

Thanks for reading! ðŸš€
