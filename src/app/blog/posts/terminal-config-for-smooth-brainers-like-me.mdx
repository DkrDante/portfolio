# My Developer Workflow Using macOS, tmux, and Neovim with Lazy Config

Welcome to yet another developer setup post, because apparently, configuring a terminal is a personality trait now. But hey, if you want to look like a real hacker while barely writing any code, stick around.

## Operating System

I use **macOS** because it’s Unix-based, has great developer tools, and lets me feel superior to Windows users. Plus, Homebrew makes package management so easy that I barely have to think—which, frankly, is ideal.

## Shell

macOS ships with **zsh** by default, and since resisting defaults takes effort, I stick with it.

SIKE

I use iterm2 like a basic bitch with nerd font because .... are these jokes even landing, unlike the jokes the config hits hard
To make my terminal look unnecessarily fancy, I use **Powerlevel10k** because a cluttered prompt full of useless information is the peak of productivity, or atleast helps to see which branch you are on and how behind so that next time you dont lose all of your progress in a rebase issue during your hackathon.

### Installing Powerlevel10k

```sh
brew install romkatv/powerlevel10k/powerlevel10k
```

Then, make your terminal even more unreadable:

```sh
p10k configure
```

## Prompt Configuration

Here’s my **Powerlevel10k** configuration snippet, because looking at my CPU usage while writing JavaScript makes me feel like I’m doing something important:

```sh
# ~/.zshrc
source $(brew --prefix)/share/powerlevel10k/powerlevel10k.zsh-theme
```

## Persistent Terminal Sessions with tmux

**tmux** lets me keep my terminal sessions open forever, because closing things properly is overrated.

### My tmux Workflow

I use tmux so I can jump between projects without using my mouse like some kind of casual:

```sh
alias work="tmux attach-session -t work"
```

Now I can type `work` and get back to whatever I was pretending to do before.

## Neovim with Lazy Config

I use **Neovim** because VS Code opens too fast and I like the thrill of debugging my own editor.

### Installing Neovim and Lazy.nvim

```sh
brew install neovim
```

To set up Lazy.nvim, the best plugin manager since sliced bread:

```sh
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim ~/.config/nvim/lazy.nvim
```

### My Neovim Config

Because configuring an editor should take longer than actually coding.

## Productivity Boosters

A few more tools to pretend I’m getting work done:

- **[zoxide](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide)** – Because typing full directory paths is for amateurs.
- **[eza](https://github.com/eza-community/eza)** – A modern replacement for `ls` that makes me feel like I’m using a cutting-edge system instead of just listing files.
- **[fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)** – Fuzzy finding, because typing the full file name is too much effort.

### My `zshrc` Aliases

```sh
alias ll="eza -l --icons"
alias llt="eza -T --icons"
alias z="zoxide"
```

## Conclusion

And that’s my setup—because spending days perfecting a terminal environment is obviously the best way to be productive. Hopefully, this post has inspired you to sink a few hours into tweaking your setup instead of actually working. Enjoy your perfectly configured development environment, which will surely make you write better code… or at least look like you do.
