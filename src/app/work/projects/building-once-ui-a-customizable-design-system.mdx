# Case Study: Training AI to Play Flappy Bird Using the NEAT Algorithm

## Introduction

Flappy Bird is a simple yet challenging game where a player controls a bird and must navigate through a series of pipes without colliding. The objective of this case study is to train an AI agent to play Flappy Bird effectively using the **NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT)** algorithm. NEAT is a genetic algorithm that evolves neural networks over generations, allowing the AI to improve its decision-making over time.

## Problem Definition

The AI needs to control the bird, deciding whether to **jump** (flap) or do nothing (fall) based on the environment. The goal is to maximize the score by passing through as many pipes as possible.

### Input Features

The neural network receives the following input parameters:

- The bird’s **vertical position**.
- The **distance** to the next pipe.
- The **height of the top pipe**.
- The **height of the bottom pipe**.
- The bird’s **vertical velocity**.

### Output

- A single output neuron that determines whether the bird **flaps (1)** or **does nothing (0)**.

## Why Use NEAT?

NEAT is effective for this problem because:

- It **evolves both the structure and weights** of the neural network, starting from simple networks and increasing complexity as needed.
- It uses **speciation** to preserve diversity and prevent premature convergence.
- It allows for **crossover and mutation**, enabling continuous improvement of solutions.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Setting Up the Environment

- We use **Python** with the **NEAT-Python** library.
- A Flappy Bird environment is created using **Pygame** or **Flappy Bird Gym**.

### 2. Initializing the NEAT Algorithm

- Define a **configuration file** for NEAT, specifying parameters such as population size, mutation rates, and network structure.
- Initialize a **population** of simple neural networks with random weights.

### 3. Evaluating Fitness

- Each neural network controls a Flappy Bird agent.
- The fitness function is defined as:
  - **Fitness = Score** (number of pipes passed).
  - **Penalty for collisions** to ensure survival-based evolution.

### 4. Evolutionary Process

- **Selection**: The best-performing agents are chosen to pass their genes to the next generation.
- **Crossover**: Two high-performing networks combine to create offspring.
- **Mutation**: Small changes in weights and structure introduce variations to avoid stagnation.
- **Speciation**: NEAT groups similar networks to maintain diversity and prevent dominant species from taking over too early.

### 5. Training and Improvement

- The AI runs for multiple generations (~50-100).
- Over time, networks learn to optimize their jumping behavior based on pipe positions.
- The best-performing networks are saved and tested.

## Conclusion

The NEAT algorithm successfully trains an AI to play Flappy Bird by evolving neural networks that learn optimal jumping strategies. This case study demonstrates how neuroevolution can solve decision-based problems without explicit programming, showcasing the power of AI in game-playing applications.

## Future Work

- Implement **reinforcement learning (e.g., Deep Q-Learning)** to compare performance with NEAT.
- Optimize neural network architectures to **reduce computational complexity**.
- Experiment with different fitness functions for enhanced learning.
