# Case Study: Forcing an AI to Suffer Through Flappy Bird with NEAT

## Introduction

Flappy Bird: a game so frustrating that it made people throw their phones, yet simple enough that even an AI should be able to handle it. Right? Well, let’s find out. This case study documents our attempt to train an AI to play Flappy Bird using the **NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT)** algorithm—because if humans can’t master it, maybe evolution itself can.

## Problem Definition

Our AI needs to control the bird, making the critical life decision of whether to **jump** (flap) or do nothing (fall) based on the environment. The ultimate goal? To rack up a high score and make us look like fools in comparison.

### Input Features

The neural network is given the following critical life-or-death details:

- The bird’s **vertical position** (because gravity is a thing).
- The **distance** to the next pipe (aka impending doom).
- The **height of the top pipe** (for a rude awakening when miscalculated).
- The **height of the bottom pipe** (for an equally rude awakening in the opposite direction).
- The bird’s **vertical velocity** (aka how fast it’s plummeting toward failure).

### Output

- A single output neuron that determines whether the bird **flaps (1)** or **accepts its fate (0)**.

## Why Subject an AI to This?

NEAT is ideal for this problem because:

- It **evolves both the structure and weights** of the neural network, meaning our AI starts off completely clueless (like us) and slowly figures things out (unlike us).
- It uses **speciation** to keep diversity in the population, so not all AIs become identical copies of the same bad idea.
- It supports **crossover and mutation**, which keeps things interesting and helps prevent a tragic case of all our AI birds collectively diving into the first pipe.

## The Grand Plan: Implementation Steps

### 1. Setting Up the AI’s New Torture Chamber

- We use **Python** with the **NEAT-Python** library because why make things harder for ourselves?
- A Flappy Bird environment is set up using **Pygame** or **Flappy Bird Gym**, ensuring a proper playground for digital suffering.

### 2. Initializing the NEAT Algorithm

- Define a **configuration file** with population size, mutation rates, and all the other details that make this simulation either a grand success or a spectacular failure.
- Start with a **population** of clueless neural networks making hilariously bad decisions.

### 3. Evaluating Fitness (Or, Measuring How Badly They Fail)

- Each neural network gets a chance to control a Flappy Bird agent and prove its worth.
- Fitness function:
  - **Fitness = Score** (number of pipes successfully passed—shocking, I know).
  - **Penalty for crashing** (because mindlessly flying into walls shouldn’t be rewarded).

### 4. The Evolutionary Struggle

- **Selection**: The best-performing birds are chosen to pass on their (somewhat) superior genes.
- **Crossover**: Two high-performing birds have offspring that hopefully inherit the good traits (and not the suicidal tendencies).
- **Mutation**: Random tweaks introduce new behaviors, ensuring we don’t end up with a bunch of identical failures.
- **Speciation**: NEAT groups similar networks together to prevent a single overpowered strategy from wiping out all innovation.

### 5. Training and Watching the Chaos Unfold

- The AI runs for multiple generations (~50-100) until it starts making better decisions—or at least stops embarrassing itself as much.
- Over time, networks learn to avoid pipes and optimize their jumping strategy.
- The best-performing networks are saved and tested, providing us with an AI that can play Flappy Bird better than most humans.

## Conclusion

The NEAT algorithm proves that, given enough time and failed attempts, an AI can figure out how to play Flappy Bird without rage-quitting. This case study highlights the power of neuroevolution to develop decision-making strategies without explicit programming, which is both fascinating and slightly terrifying.

## Future Torture—Err, Work

- Implement **reinforcement learning (e.g., Deep Q-Learning)** to see if another AI can do even better (or worse—who knows?).
- Optimize neural network architectures to **reduce computational complexity**, because efficiency is always a good excuse for more tweaking.
- Experiment with different fitness functions to encourage even smarter behavior (or at least less embarrassing failures).

This case study provides a roadmap for training AI using NEAT in a game environment, proving that if you throw enough computation at a problem, even a clueless AI bird can eventually soar. Or at least survive more than three pipes.
